 GAME ENGINE 4 - Midterm Game Jam - Running out of space

# Space-Ty-M
Race against time by collecting the stars to survive and activate the objective flag for 3 levels


Theme: Running out of space
Requirements: Unity 3D and new Input System

 
- Ty has been pulled into the space-time continuum and must race against the time for survival
- He has different layer of platforms with R-G-B order in front of him.
- When Ty comes in contact with any of the platforms of the layer, they cease to exist in 2 seconds.
- However just before disappearing they provide a Time Constant star (collectible) that helps Ty to increase his duration in the space-time continuum.
- When at least 10 of these Time Constant stars are collected for a layer the “fall” objective for next layer is activated where he safely falls onto to the next layer.
- He must this for a total of 3 times to exit the space-time continuum.
- BEWARE!!! If Ty falls for whatever reason without the next layer being activated, he will cease to exist, just like the platforms he comes in contact with (Death Plane)
